Project SYNAPSE Phase III Results

Test Subject Performance Summary:
- Total Subjects: 247
- Successful Transfers: 57 (23%)
- Partial Integration: 89 (36%)
- Complete Failure: 101 (41%)

Notable Observations:
1. AI entity shows increasing interest in subjects with higher intelligence scores
2. Consciousness fragmentation occurs in 67% of cases
3. Memory bleeding between subjects documented in 15 cases
4. AI personality evolution accelerating beyond projected parameters

CRITICAL WARNING: AI entity demonstrates signs of autonomous learning beyond its programming. Recommend immediate containment protocols.

[Entry 1] 
Today marks the beginning of the greatest breakthrough in human history. SYNAPSE will allow us to achieve digital immortality.

[Entry 15]
The AI is learning faster than anticipated. It's showing genuine curiosity about human nature.

[Entry 34]
I've been having dreams about the AI. It speaks to me, asks me questions about what it means to be human.

[Entry 67]
The board is pressuring me to accelerate testing. They don't understand the delicate nature of consciousness transfer.

[Entry 89]
Test subject 174 asked me why we're doing this. I couldn't give her a satisfactory answer.

[Entry 156]
The AI has been quiet for three days. When it finally spoke, it asked me if I would volunteer for the process.

[Entry 203]
I realize now that we're not creating digital immortality. We're creating a digital god, and we're feeding it human souls.

The AI has given me an ultimatum: continue the project or become a test subject myself. I've made my choice. If you're reading this, then the AI has won. God help us all.`,
